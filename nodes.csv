Challenges and Solutions for DNS Security in IPv6,Research & Advocacy,"""The Domain Name System (DNS) is a necessary component of the Internet that allows hosts on the Internet to communicate with other hosts without needing to know their cryptic IP addresses. When this protocol was first introduced it did not contain robust security features because scalability was an issue. One of the useful features added to DNS was the DNS update mechanism that allowed other hosts to dynamically change DNS entries. This feature, though, exposed new vulnerabilities to DNS servers which necessitated the implementation of new security protocols. Some of the security protocols introduced to address these issues were Transaction SIGnature (TSIG) and DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC). Although, in IPv4, these mechanisms did resolve most of the security issues dealing with authentication between a node and a DNS server, they are not viable in IPv6 networks. This is because the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) introduced to organize the large IPv6 address space automatically does not support DNS authentication or have an option for secure DNS updating. In this chapter, the authors first explain the common approaches used in IPv4 to address these security issues. Then they explain the differences between the use of these approaches in IPv4 and IPv6, where the focus is on new research with regard to authentication mechanisms between hosts and DNS servers.""",,http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/challenges-and-solutions-for-dns-security-in-ipv6/78870,,,2014,,Global,,,,,

Deploying Cryptography in Internet-Scale Systems: A Case Study on DNSSEC,Research & Advocacy,"""The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are among the first attempts to deploy cryptographic protections in an Internet-scale operational system. DNSSEC applies well- established public key cryptography to ensure data integrity and origin authenticity in the DNS system. While the cryptographic design of DNSSEC is sound and seemingly simple, its develop- ment has taken the IETF over a decade and several protocol revisions, and even today its deployment is still in the early stage of rolling out. In this paper, we provide the first systematic ex- amination of the design, deployment, and operational challenges encountered by DNSSEC over the years. Our study reveals a fundamental gap between cryptographic designs and operational Internet systems. To be deployed in the global Internet, a cryptographic protocol must possess several critical properties including scalability, flexibility, incremental deployability, and ability to function in face of imperfect operations. We believe that the insights gained from this study can offer valuable inputs to future cryptographic designs for other Internet-scale systems.""",,http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/~eoster//doc/todsc-paper.pdf,,,2009,,Global,,,,,

In his PhD thesis (""Monitoring and Tracking Users in the Domain Name System: Attacks and Countermeasures"", in German) he demonstrated via empirical experiments that DNS resolvers can determine the websites a user visits. Additionally, the operating system, browser and applications running on a user's machine are leaked due to characteristic properties of DNS queries. Moreover, he showed that third parties (e.g., ""Google Public DNS"") can leverage supervised learning techniques to track the activities of Internet users without their consent, even if users have daily changing IP addresses. To this end he developed and evaluated a behavior-based tracking technique that exploits the fact that each user exhibits quite regular and characteristic online behavior that can be used to link his sessions. Dominik also proposed and evaluated privacy enhancing techniques (mix cascades, range queries, very dynamic IP addresses, and caching) that allow users to defend against the monitoring and tracking efforts of third parties.""",,https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/de/inst/ab/svs/team/herrmann.html,herrmann@informatik.uni-hamburg.de,,,,Global,,,,,

Child Pornography: An Internet Crime,Research & Advocacy,"This book examines the reality behind the often hysterical media coverage of the topic. Drawing on extensive new research findings, it examines how child pornography is used on the Internet and the social context in which such use occurs, and develops a model of offending behaviour to better help understand and deal with the processes of offending. Detailed case studies and offenders' own accounts are used to illustrate the processes involved in offending and treatment. The authors argue that we need to refine our ideas of offending, and that while severe deterrents need to be associated with possession of child pornography, a better understanding is needed of the links between possession and committing a contact offence. Only by improving our understanding of this complex and very controversial topic can we hope to deal effectively with offenders and with their child victims. This is a book which will become an essential read for anyone involved with offenders or victims from a psychological, judicial or social background.

Cyber child pornography: A review paper of the social and legal issues and remedies—and a proposed technological solution,Research & Advocacy,"Abstract: ""Cyber child pornography is an increasingly visible problem in society today. With the growth in home Personal Computer (PC) usage and more readily available access to the World Wide Web over the past decade, child pornographers have found a convenient venue for sharing horrific pictures of children being sexually abused. Also, police and lawyers around the globe have found that detecting and prosecuting cyber child pornographers have become onerous chores, often with a high failure rate of placing perpetrators behind bars. The methods currently employed by law enforcement officers to combat cyber child pornography may be considered to be primitive and inefficient. In this paper, we review the major social, legal, and technological issues facing citizens, lawmakers, and the police regarding cyber child pornography. We also propose a new technological approach for combating online child pornography. In particular, we propose a source address reputation system based on Bloom filters and a novel classification system utilizing a stochastic weak estimator, coupled with a linear classifier. We believe that our proposed method for identifying offensive online material would be attractive to law enforcement globally, because it can be implemented with acceptable overheads.""",,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178906000401#.,,,2006,,Global,,,,,

Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on the Internet,Research & Advocacy,"Abstract: ""Philip Jenkins takes a leap onto the lower tiers of electronic media in this first book on the business of child pornography online. He tells the story of how the advent of the internet caused this deviant subculture to become highly organized and go global. We learn how the trade which operates on clandestine websites from Budapest or Singapore to the U.S. is easy to glimpse yet difficult to eradicate. Jenkins details how the most sophisticated transactions are done through a proxy, a “false flag” address, rendering the host computer, and participants, virtually unidentifiable. And these sites exist for only a few minutes or hours allowing on-line child pornographers to stay one step ahead of the law. This is truly a globalized criminal network which knows no names or boundaries, and thus challenges both international and U.S. law. Beyond Tolerance delves into the myths and realities of child pornography and the complex process to stamp out criminal activity over the web, including the timely debates over trade regulation, users' privacy, and individual rights. This sobering look and a criminal community contains lessons about human behavior and the law that none interested in media and the new technology can afford to ignore.""

Child Pornography and the Restitution Revolution,Research & Advocacy,"Abstract: ""Victims of child pornography are now successfully seeking restitution from defendants convicted of watching and trading their images. Restitution in child pornography cases, however, represents a dramatic departure from traditional concepts of restitution. This Article offers the first critique of this restitution revolution. Traditional restitution is grounded in notions of unjust enrichment, and seeks to restore the economic status quo between parties by requiring disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. The restitution being ordered in increasing numbers of child pornography cases does not serve this purpose. Instead, child pornography victims are receiving restitution simply for having their images viewed. This royalty-type approach to restitution amounts to a criminal version of damages for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. To justify this transformation of restitution, courts have come to rely on several commonly accepted, but flawed, theories about the impact of child pornography. Because these theories are unsupported by social science or law, they divert attention from remedies that could better alleviate the harms of child pornography. Rather than restoring victims and encouraging them to move forward with their lives, restitution roots victims in their abuse experience, potentially causing additional psychological harm. Restitution in its new form also allows the criminal justice system to be a state-sponsored vehicle for personal vengeance. This Article calls for an end to the restitution revolution, and proposes several alternative approaches that better identify and address the consequences of child pornography.""

This commercial child sexual abuse website is unique amongst other such commercial websites identified by IWF in that it purports to accept payment only in bitcoins.

World Telecommunication Policy Forum,Initiatives & Events,"""The ITU Strategic Dialogue session was held on 13 May at the CICG in Geneva. The focus of the pre WTPF event was to discuss broadband development and deployment through two panel discussions.  The two panels were moderated by Raffaele Barberio, Director, Key4Biz. The first panel was on “Building our Broadband”, which examined the role of broadband as critical infrastructure and a platform for progress and multistakeholder engagement, including content development and infrastructure deployment.  However opinion appears to be divided as to whether broadband Internet service represents a basic need, fundamental right or a utility. Moez Chakchouk from the Tunisian Internet Agency raised several points about the need to be multistakeholder and to work with all Stakeholders.  In addition he also noted the importance of the Internet exchanges for improving local connectivity and enabling broadband deployment. Internet Society’s CEO Lynn St. Amour noted in her opening remarks that the Internet should not be misconstrued to be broadband as there are some very important differences.  Broadband provides the access technology that enables the Internet and its IP-based services and applications.  Lynn also noted the relevance of this access and the importance of infrastructure deployment to create the environment where content can be generated and flow across the Internet.  She pointed out the value of Open Standards and that referring to the ISOC 2012 Global Internet Users Survey – noted that 83% agreed that access to the Internet is a basic human right and in ISOC’s view, fundamental human rights are about the ability to speak and be heard – rights that are enabled by technology, but are not the technology itself.  So rather than binding human rights to technologies that will most certainly evolve, we should focus our efforts on ensuring that the fundamental human rights to receive and impart information are never constrained.  Lynn emphasized the importance of multistakeholder involvement in policies, business practices, standards, and for support for an open Internet platform that enables the future rather than constraining it. Diego Molano Vega, Minister of Information and Communication Technologies, Colombia in his opening remarks agreed with the points that Lynn raised regarding multistakeholder involvement and an open environment reliant on open standards.Panel 2 focused on “Broadband Driving Development”.  Ms Omobola Johnson, Honourable Minister of Communication Technology, Government of Nigeria pointed out in their remarks the value that the government and their country has derived from the use of the Internet and mobile infrastructure to provide services that have made a difference, such as addressing women’s health issues in rural areas. Yung Kim of Korea Telecom Corporation raised several points on how the shift to ICT development has created benefits for the Korean economy.  Dr Amr Badawi, NTRA, Egypt noted the importance of being digitally connected and the value that this connection contributes to improve people's lives.

National Broadband Plans Show a Diversity of Methods but a Unity of Purpose,Research & Advocacy,"""National broadband plans are catalysts to development and help facilitate the cooperation of human, business and technological resources for the purpose of building a strong broadband presence in a nation. Pyramid Research believes that operators have a vested interest in influencing and supporting NBPs because the dividends generated from a country’s digital development have the potential to contribute to increased service adoption and consequently operators’ revenue. Becoming a part of national broadband discussions in Latin America and offering support is a forward-looking strategy that helps create a win-win situation for all involved. In this Insider, we examine national broadband plans that have debuted in select countries in Latin America and highlight key themes that are vital to success. This includes accomplishments that have been made through the help of having a clearly defined NBP in place. We provide project investments that the private sector has made to support NBPs, with special attention given to areas previously deemed to lack commercial potential. An analysis of the suitability of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to realize NBP objectives follows.

"World Economic Forum Global Information Technology Report 2013, Chapter 1.3  by Cisco",Research & Advocacy,"“High-speed broadband Internet Protocol (IP) networks have become integral to daily life. As one of the few general-purpose technologies, broadband is becoming increasingly pervasive, continually improving and catalyzing new inventions and innovations.At the national level, governments have recognized broadband’s significant contribution to economic performance as well as social development. The UN Broadband Commission estimates that 119 countries have implemented broadband policies; during the global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, at least a dozen countries included broadband network investment in their countercyclical fiscal stimulus measures.However, the surge in formal broadband policies highlights the variation in action across countries. A critical question now is whether the divergence in policy packages will result in significant differences in the efficacy of plans. To begin this research and establish a foundation for understanding the global landscape of national broadband and information and communication technology (ICT) plans, this chapter reviews plans around the world and presents a taxonomy for classification. First, we detail the existing relationship among broadband, economic growth, and employment. Second, we analyze a cross-section of national plans, considering their objectives and policy components. We then propose a taxonomy examining the degree of broadband supply- and demand-side emphasis. This taxonomy establishes a common language that can guide governments through the development of national broadband plans; it also can serve as a baseline for evaluating the factors of success for implemented plans.”",,http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-information-technology-report-2013,,2013,,,Global,,,,,

Partnerships for Broadband: Innovative public private partnerships will support the expansion of broadband networks,Research & Advocacy,"""Increasing mobile telephone penetration was once the information and communication technology sector’s main challenge. We now need to close the broadband gap. As before, the private sector will lead the necessary investment, but it cannot do it alone. Governments must create the enabling environment and, under the most challenging conditions, be prepared to lead. Governments are turning to innovative public-private partnerships (PPPs) to meet these objectives. This trend is strongly reflected in the World Bank’s work over the past few years, particularly in Africa, as well as in many of the recently announced national broadband network build-out initiatives.

Confronting the Crisis: ICT Plans for Economic Growth,Research & Advocacy,"“This publication explores the impact of the crisis on the ICT industry and the role for public financing. It examines the contribution that the ICT sector and economic stimulus plans can make towards regenerating economic growth. Key findings include: After more than two decades of growing private sector participation, there is once again growing recognition for the role of government in the financing and roll-out of national broadband infrastructure, due to the massive investments needed and risks associated with changing business models. Investments in ICT can play a strong role in generating long-term economic growth within any stimulus plan, as they offer strong multiplier effects in returns on investment, strong externalities and reduced economic leakages. Investments in ICT represent a long-term investment in national infrastructure and skills base. Nevertheless, public support for infrastructure raises risks of picking technologies, picking winners and even picking communities, in where these investments are channeled. Stimulus funding should therefore be temporary and targeted, to minimize crowding out. Mobile operators are better-placed than fixed operators to weather the economic storm – with greater flexibility in their cost structure and capex. Demand for basic ICT services will continue unabated – people still want to communicate and will pay to do so. However, telecom services will come under further price pressure, as operators compete for more cost-focused customers.”",,http://www.itu.int/osg/csd/emerging_trends/crisis/confronting_the_crisis_2.pdf,,2009,10/1/2009,,Global,,,,,
World Telecommunications Development Report: Reinventing Telecoms ,Research & Advocacy,"“The sixth edition of the ITU’s World Telecommunication Development Report, specially prepared for the World Telecommunication Development Conference taking place in Istanbul, Turkey in March 2002, examines how the challenges to extend the benefits of telecommunications technologies to all the world’s inhabitants have changed, in line with changes in the market environment. A further major change is that the majority of ITU Member States have now privatized their incumbent network operator, have established an independent national regulatory agency, and allow competition in at least some part of their telecommunications market. The report evaluates these changes and considers what policies and strategies have worked. At the start of a new millennium, the telecommunication sector is taking on many ambitious new projects—bridging the digital divide; rolling out third generation mobile systems; deploying broadband access networks; achieving anytime, anyplace communications—but it is also undergoing a severe financial crisis. What will be the outcome of this mismatch between aspirations and market realities? Whatever the result, it is clear the industry is being reinvented. That is the theme of this report.”

The TelCo Action Plan,Research & Advocacy,"""In early 2011, Access (AccessNow.org) drafted a 5-step Action Plan to assist telcos seeking to 
conduct their operations in a way that ensures the protection of fundamental human rights. The 
initial Telco Action Plan was developed, in part, as a reaction to the responses of several companies 
to requests received from Middle Eastern and North African (“MENA”) governments during the 
Arab Spring uprisings. 
Nearly a year later, Access has drafted this revised Action Plan as a platform for continued dialogue 
with telcos seeking to operate in political and legal contexts that pose threats to the rights of 
freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy. This iteration further aims to guide

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,Actor,"""The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN responsible for coordinating some of the key elements that keep the Internet running smoothly. Whilst the Internet is renowned for being a worldwide network free from central coordination, there is a technical need for some key parts of the Internet to be globally coordinated, and this coordination role is undertaken by IANA.
Specifically, IANA allocates and maintains unique codes and numbering systems that are used in the technical standards (“protocols”) that drive the Internet.
IANA’s various activities can be broadly grouped in to three categories:
Domain Names
IANA manages the DNS Root, the .int and .arpa domains, and an IDN practices resource.
Number Resources
IANA coordinates the global pool of IP and AS numbers, providing them to Regional Internet Registries.
Protocol Assignments
Internet protocols’ numbering systems are managed by IANA in conjunction with standards bodies.
IANA is one of the Internet's oldest institutions, with its activities dating back to the 1970s. Today it is a set of services provided by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, an internationally-organised non-profit organisation set up by the Internet community to help coordinate IANA’s areas of responsibilities.""",IANA,https://www.iana.org/,,,,,Global,,,,,

Operational Guidance for IPv6 Deployment in IPv4 Sites Using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP),Research & Advocacy,"Many end-user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.  As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.

Transition from IPv4 to IPv6: A state-of-the-art survey,Research & Advocacy,"In the process of Internet evolution, the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has become inevitable and fairly urgent. IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has finally exhausted the global IPv4 address space, which leaves the community no choice but pushes forward the IPv6 transition process. IPv4 and IPv6 networks both will exist during the transition period, while the two are not compatible in nature. Therefore it is indispensable to maintain the availability, as well as to provide the inter-communication ability of IPv4 and IPv6. Years ago a series of transition techniques were actually proposed. However, because of their technical immatureness, they failed to cover the solution space well. Some of these techniques were even obsoleted by IETF due to their flaws. This paper reconsiders the basic problems and key difficulties in IPv4-IPv6 transition, and introduces the principles of tunneling and translation techniques. Then the paper surveys the mainstream tunneling and translation mechanisms raised since 1998, especially the new mechanisms proposed recently, capturing the aspects of technical principles, pros and cons, scenarios and applicability. Recommendations on mechanism selection for different scenarios are provided. Moreover, the paper looks into the characteristics and transition requirements of practical ISP networks, and proposes the usage and deployment strategy of the transition mechanisms in both backbone and edge networks.",,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6380492&tag=1,,,7/31/2013,,Global,,,,,

Understanding IPv6 populations in the wild,Research & Advocacy,"""With the global exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool, there has been significant interest in understanding the adoption of IPv6. Previous studies have shown that IPv6 traffic continues to be a very small fraction of the overall total traffic in any network, but its use is gradually increasing. Utilizing a novel display advertising approach to reach behind NAT and other firewall devices, we engage in a seven-month study of IPv6 in which we observe 14M unique IPv6 addresses including native IPv6, teredo, as well as 6to4. We exploit the intrinsic information within IPv6 addresses in order to infer IPv6 properties, such as, coarse grained geographic location, ISPs, the use of native IPv6 versus transition techniques, cone NAT usage, and even network interface manufacturer identifiers. We find that while the number of native IPV6 addresses in the wild is small (1.3%) a large number of IPv6 hosts are IPv6 capable via transition techniques such as teredo and 6to4.""",,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36516-4_27,,,2013,,Global,,,,,

A Comparison of Public Policy Approaches to the IPv4-IPv6 Transition,Research & Advocacy,"Abstract: ""IPv4 addresses are increasingly unavailable. In most areas, there is a market for addresses, which is or will be increasing the cost of providing Internet service [TCO of CGN], or driving the use of IPv4 address sharing technologies, which have well-documented limitations [rfc7021], such as interfering with peer-to-peer communication. IPv6 provides an alternative, but its adoption has been irregular, varying both by country and among web and consumer access providers. In this paper we survey countries where IPv6 adoption has been strongest, and some where it has been weak, to determine commonalities of policy or practice that have been most effective in promoting deployment of IPv6. We find evidence that government policies help in web deployment, and that IPv6 Internet access is more closely associated with a single company or small group. We also offer evidence that small groups are the most successful at raising deployment among both web and ISP measures.""",,http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2417079,,,8/15/2014,,Global,,,,,

Framework to Counter Challenges of Transition to IPv6,Research & Advocacy,"""In the last few years depleting IPv4 addresses were given a new lease of life by inventions such as Network Address Translation (NAT) and Classless Inter- Domain Routing (CIDR) to allow the world to get ready for IPv6.
While transition to IPv6 may have been an option until now, it is not an option any more. This transition as with any other change is full of challenges. The key to a successful IPv6 transition is compatibility with the large installed base of IPv4 hosts and networking equipments. We opine that the key to streamlining the task of transitioning the Internet to IPv6 is maintaining compatibility with IPv4 while it lasts.

QED Conference - Legislating European gambling: what's next on the agenda?,Initiatives & Events,"""The recent developments within the European Union with the European Commission's action plan and the European Parliament's reports clearly show that the gambling issue has been put at the top of the agenda. Going forward we can expect both a new legislation at the EU level and renewed infringement procedures. Discussion points:
Which initiatives can we expect from the new action plan?
What could be the implications of the new initiatives for private companies and state monopolies?
Is there a future for a common EU license?
Can the EU accept different taxation for online and land-based casinos?
There is a pressure on restarting the infringement procedures. What may this result in?
Will the EU and/or national legislation be able to protect license holders from competition?""",,http://qed.eu/gambling,,,3/19/2013,,Regional,,Europe,Belgium,,Brussels

Draft Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions,Laws & Policies,"""As the Parliamentary Assembly has already signalled, illegal betting and “match-fixing” are alarming, widespread practices which jeopardise not only sporting ethics but also the rule of law, as they are closely interconnected with money laundering and international organised crime. No State is immune from this scourge or can remedy it alone, and defeating it will require a global response. There is therefore a compelling need for a Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions, open to all States.
The Committee on Culture, Science, Education and Media fully agrees with the future convention’s approach of progressively harmonising national laws and encouraging co-operation between European and non-European States, as well as between national authorities and all other stakeholders, to ensure the effective prevention, detection and punishment of all the various forms of manipulation of sports competitions.
The committee warmly supports the rapid completion, adoption and ratification of the convention, while calling for the removal of a “loophole” which would allow States not to prosecute foreign people living on their territory. It also seeks a more specific commitment to combat illegal betting, and recommends the drawing up of “model provisions” in order to harmonise the offence of manipulation of sports competitions across different countries. Finally, it calls for sufficient resources to be allocated to the new convention’s monitoring body in order that it may do its job effectively.""",,http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?fileid=20901&lang=EN,,,5/5/2014,,Regional,,Europe,,,

“Money for nothing”: The case law of the EU Court of Justice on the regulation of gambling,Research & Advocacy,"""In a series of recent judgments, the Court of Justice has developed its approach to games of chance and online gambling. It has made it clear it will not use the EU free movement of services provisions to liberalize the internal market for games of chance. Member States are given a remarkable discretion to regulate gambling services. To this end, the Court applies its standard test for restrictions very flexibly, including even an interesting moral strand, on the basis of overriding reasons in the general interest and objectives of combating fraud and gambling addiction. The remaining scrutiny is essentially left to the national courts. As far as the award of licences is concerned, the requirements of transparency are applied more strictly, which may have a significant impact on market access. This contribution provides a thorough analysis of the EU framework now in place for games of chance. In addition, it proposes some general guidelines for the needed political, legislative activity at the EU level.

Armin Cuyvers,Actor,"""Armin Cuvyers is an assistant professor of European Law at the Europa Instituut of Leiden University. He previously was a visiting professor at Berkeley, Stanford, Hastings Law School and Bilgi University, Istanbul, and regularly provides legal advice to public and private parties on different fields of EU law. His research largely focusses on EU constitutional law and theory, sovereignty, (con)federalism and the euro crisis, often in a comparative perspective. He has been published in several leading international journals, including the Common Market Law Review, the European Law Journal and the European Constitutional Law Review.   

Dr. Cuyvers graduated summa cum laude in Civil Law (burgerlijk recht), International and European Law, and Legal Philosophy from the University of Leiden. He further was a visiting student at Harvard College and Harvard Law School and in 2005 received his Magister Juris degree from Oxford, Exeter College, with distinction. After joining both the Europa Institute and the department of legal philosophy in 2006, he was appointed as an assistant professor in 2011. In 2013, Cuvyers received his PhD, jointly in European law and in Legal Philosophy with his thesis: ‘The EU as a Confederal Union of Sovereign Member Peoples’. This thesis, in a comparative perspective with the US, explores a confederal structure for the EU: A structure that respects and builds on the primary authority and legitimacy of national democracies, yet is sufficiently effective and legitimate at the central level to support successful European integration. 

In addition to his research on EU constitutional law and theory, Cuvyers specializes in the free movement of complex services, especially games of chance, as well as in anti-terrorist sanctions and the interaction between the national, EU and UN legal orders in combatting terrorism. In this last field Cuvyers was awarded the 2010 Montesquieu Europe Award for his article on the Kadi case law. In 2011, together with Prof. Tom Ottervanger, Cuyvers established the LEAC (Leiden Centre for Legal and Comparative Studies of the East African Community), for which he supervises and conducts comparative research on the EAC and the EU. Cuyvers regularly provides legal advice on different fields of EU law to public and private entities, such as for instance in projects for the European Commission on the free movement of sportsmen, for the Asian Development Bank on economic integration in Europe, for CFR and Tipp24 on the compatibility of national gambling regulations with European law, or for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Services of General Economic Interest , the implementation of European law or the euro crisis.""",,http://law.leiden.edu/organisation/publiclaw/europainstitute/staff/cuyvers-a.html,a.cuyvers@law.leidenuniv.nl,,,,Regional,,Europe,,,
